A warm welcome to the Springboard Foundations of Data Science Workshop!

Our team of industry experts has picked the best learning resources on Data Science and structured them into a logical curriculum below for you. Note that the individual resources need not be authored in-house, but are curated from the best in the field. We do provide the glue that stitches everything together. We believe this is our unique strength - we stand on the shoulders of giants, instead of being restricted to in-house content.

Think of us as a college professor who creates a curriculum with the most formidable book chapters, research papers, projects instead of teaching from only her own textbook.
As you work through the material, click "Mark Complete" and submit project files whenever you are done with a sub-unit. Any units you've marked as "complete" earlier through your Springboard account will be shown as "complete" here, too. If there are topics you are already familiar with, or feel are not relevant to your learning goals - you may discuss with your mentor and skip ahead.

We have a recommended schedule (~10 hours/week) so that the class can follow a rhythm and maximize benefit from discussions. However, this is a self-paced course, so feel free to go faster or slower as you please.

- Week 1:  Modules 1 & 2 - Introduction, Programming in R
- Week 2:  Module 3 -  Data wrangling, Capstone project proposal
- Weeks 3 & 4:  Module 4 - Probability and Statistics
- Week 5 & 6:  Modules 5 & 6 - EDA, Data Story, Capstone project milestone
- Week 7 - 9:  Module 7 - Data analysis in depth
- Week 10 - 12: Optional Elective & Capstone project final

Let's dive in!

2 PROGRAMMING IN R  <i class= "icon-clock"></i>~  6+ Hours
==
***
R, a programming language mainly designed for statistical analysis, has become one of the most prominent languages in the data science world, besides Python. In this module, you’ll first learn R through an in-browser, interactive series of exercises designed by DataCamp. After that, you’ll learn to install R on your machine along with RStudio, a programming environment for R. Finally, you’ll learn to use R markdown to create documentation, and use github as a code repository.

Together, this set of tools is an authentic representation of what you might be using day-to-day in a data scientist industry role.

##2.1CORE RESOURCES FOR LEARNING R <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~6+ Hours

###[<i class = "icon-video"></i> What Makes R Different <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXrHkIz-krE&feature=youtu.be)

###[<i class = "icon-video"></i>Learn R in Browser Exercise  <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~4-6 Hours](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-programming-with-swirl)
[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-programming-with-swirl) has created a fun and interactive web tutorial on top of the open-source [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) project. Warm up with in-browser R exercises without worrying about installation yet.

###[<i class = "icon-video"></i>Getting Started with R and R studio  <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~15-45 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKMsaWju8w)
A review of R and RStudio, showing where to download them, and demonstrating many of RStudio's capabilities as a programming environment for R

###[<i class = "icon-video"></i>Version Control with Git, Github and RStudio  <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~1-2Hours](https://vimeo.com/119403805)

If you don’t have a Facebook account, some reasonable people may doubt your existence in the Multiverse. Ditto for a Github account in the Tech Universe. Having an active Github portfolio is a great way to get noticed for career opportunities. We recommend you create a Github profile and submit all your projects from this course there to kickstart a handsome portfolio. 

###[<i class = "icon-video"></i>Getting Started with R Markdown  <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~1-2Hours](https://vimeo.com/142172484)
R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. Watch this tutorial from RStudio Inc. to learn to generate beautiful, well-formatted reports seamlessly combining equations, code and text.

##2.2 ADDITIONAL R RESOURCES <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~6+ Hours
***
###[<i class = "icon-link"></i>RSeek: A Search Engine for R](http://rseek.org/)
Searching for R-related help on the web can be a pain sometimes. Sasha Goodman runs a site called RSeek, which is a customized search engine for R. Think of it as a Google fine-tuned for R. For example, if your R program gives a strange error message you've never seen before, copy and paste it into RSeek and see what you find!

###[<i class = "icon-link"></i>Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
Quick-R is a great R reference website and a companion to the book, [R in Action](http://www.amazon.com/R-Action-Robert-Kabacoff/dp/1935182390). It follows a cookbook pattern, providing examples for most common tasks performed in R. Keep it on your browser every time you code!

###[<i class = "icon-link"></i>Style Guide for R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
When you’re writing an article, following certain rules-of-thumb makes your writing concise, clear and easy to follow. For example, “Don’t begin a sentence with a preposition!” ( :-) ). In programming languages too, there are guidelines laid out that make your code easier to follow and debug. In the case of R, Hadley Wickham’s guidelines are one of the most accepted ones, and as a new programmer, it would help you to follow these conventions.

##2.3 ADDITIONAL R EXERCISES <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~6+ Hours
***
###[<i class= "icon-code"></i>Codeschool: Try AAAAAR](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)

Some extra exercises that my mentor suggested. Fun and interactive like Datacamp Swirl. More early on emphasis on plotting functions.

###[<i class= "icon-code"></i>Coursera: Programming in R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)

The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis will provide working examples.
This is a 4 week course with a more academic approach to teaching. Quizzes at the end of lessons require a bit more thought, trial and error.


 
3 DATA WRANGLING<i class="icon-clock"></i> ~ 10+ Hours
==
***
One of the most time consuming steps in any data analysis is cleaning the data and getting it into a format amenable for analysis. Data wrangling, also known as Data Munging, is the process of converting data from a raw form into another format that allows for more convenient analysis of the data with the help of semi-automated tools.

##3.1 CORE RESOURCES FOR DATA WRANGLING<i class="icon-clock"></i> ~ 10+ Hours  

###[<i class = "icon-video"></i>Data Wrangling with R and RStudio <i class="icon-clock"></i> ~1-2Hours](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/data-wrangling-with-r-and-rstudio/)
A slick webinar from RStudio Inc on the use of dplyr and tidyr. These are two libraries that you'll use constantly when working with any non-trivial data set to clean and manipulate your data and get it in exactly the right form to analyze.
